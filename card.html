			<p>Orangutans are considered to be one of the Great Apes. They have thick stocky bodies, long arms, and are covered in reddish-brown hair. The name orangutan comes from the Malay and Indonesian words meaning forest person. Like people, orangutans
				have four fingers and an opposable thumb on each hand. Unlike humans, they also have opposable big toes. Male orangutans have pronounced cheek flaps.</p>
