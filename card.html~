			<p>Orangutans are considered to be one of the Great Apes. They have thick stocky bodies, long arms, and are covered in reddish-brown hair. The name Orangutan comes from the Malay and Indonesia words meaning forest human. Like humans, orangutans have four fingers and an opposable thumb on each hand. Unlike humans, they also have opposable big toes. Male orangutans have pronounced cheek flaps.</p>
